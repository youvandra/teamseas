    title: "What is the Internet Kids?",
    desc: `"The Internet Kids" refers to a few things. The Internet Kids NFT collection is an experiment in building a physical product brand, an event business, a digital community with a focus on benefiting charity, a media distribution group, and a puzzle game with a crypto reward pool that combines the digital and physical worlds, all wrapped up with an NFT art collection. But when it really comes down to it, anyone that uses the internet to improve their lives or the lives of other through online business, content, and communities is an Internet Kid.

    title: "How do I get Internet Kids Merch?",
    desc: "Every season of NFTs that we mint will coincide with a clothing drop. Every IK NFT that you hold when we release the drop will give you the right to claim one piece of clothing from that drop for free. After the free drop, we will do an exclusive, very limited clothing drop that is only available for IK NF holders to purchase. For example if you mint and hold 2 IK NFTs from season 1 you will be able to get 2 clothing items from clothing drop 1 for free and have access to clothing drop 2 which will be limited to 25 total pieces available for sale only to IK NFT holders",
